PROBLEM
Hong Kong is one of the most
competitive and costly retail
markets globally. 
Businesses are struggling to find
suitable street-front shops, while
many such shops are struggling
to attract suitable tenants. 
For small and medium-sized retailers, poor site selection often leads to high fixed costs, low
customer fit, and ultimately business failure. However, most retailers rely on personal
experience, real estate agents, or limited publicly available information for site selection
decisions currently.

SiteWise is a website designed to help small and medium-
sized retailers in Hong Kong find suitable store locations based
on their specific business needs. Users can receive data-driven
recommendations tailored to their business requirements,
rather than relying solely on intuition.

Most existing site selection tools are too
expensive for small and medium-sized retailers
to afford. Furthermore, these tools often fail to
provide a comprehensive assessment of all key
factors and rely on consultant experience.
Traditional real estate agencies primarily focus on
renting out their vacant street-front shops, rather
than considering from the retailer's perspective
which locations are more conducive to long-term
profitability.

Most of our data resources are free, our team members
have programming skills and can build their own platform,
and we don't have strict requirements regarding office
location.
Most of the data we use comes from the Hong Kong Open
Data Platform, where the data is free, plentiful, and
dynamically updated.
The models required to build the platform are widely used in
related fields, and their effectiveness is widely recognized.
FEASIBILITY
Hong Kong's retail industry is developing rapidly, and many
retailers have failed or struggled to start due to site
selection issues.
