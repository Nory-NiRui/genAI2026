in week 3 teams have started locating docs from public sources and review the info to explore what issues to focus on 
as a rule of thumb, we critically review the decisions made by the HK government and make suggestions on how to improve based on research findings and arguments 
we need to find some issues to focus on and then formulate hypothesis about possible improvement
such hypotheses may require certain evidence or info to support or prove; if such evidence is absent, we cannot support the hypotheses 
so the hypotheses are the bridge between info we find and questions we will raise for the government; they may also search for more info online in light of the hypotheses
